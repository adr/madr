# Use Asterisk as List Marker

## Context and Problem Statement

Lists in Markdown can be indicated by `*` (asterisk) or `-` (hyphen).

## Considered Options

* Use an asterisk
* Use a hyphen

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use an asterisk", because an asterisk does not have a meaning of "good" or "bad", whereas a hyphen `-` could be read as indicator of something negative (in contrast to `+`, which could be more be read as "good").

According to the [Markdown Style Guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/), an asterisk as list marker is more readable (see [readability profile](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/#readability-profile)).
