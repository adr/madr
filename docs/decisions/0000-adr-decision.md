# {ADR Decision}

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed a tool to record our decisions made in this project. Which format should these records follow?


## Considered Options

* Lightweight 
* MADR

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen option: "MADR", because
* The MADR format fits our development style
* MADR allows for structered capturing of any decision
