## Context and Problem Statement

We needed a tool to record our decisions made in this project. Which format should these records follow?


## Considered Options

Lightweight 
MADR

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR", becase
The MADR format fits our development style
MADR allows for structered capturing of any decision

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
* … <!-- numbers of consequences can vary -->

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR is confirmed. E.g., by a review or an ArchUnit test.
 Although we classify this element as optional, it is included in most ADRs.}

## More Information

{You might want to provide additional evidence/confidence for the decision outcome here and/or
 document the team agreement on the decision and/or
 define when/how this decision should be realized and if/when it should be re-visited.
Links to other decisions and resources might appear here as well.}
