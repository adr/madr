# Use Same Format for Outcomes and Options

## Context and Problem Statement

"Outcome" has "Positive Consequences" and "Negative Consequences" sections. "Options" just have a single list with "Good" and "Bad" prefixes.

Ticket: [issue#75](https://github.com/adr/madr/issues/75)

## Decision Drivers

* Consistent design of MADR
* Allow easy copy and paste

## Considered Options

* Section "Consequences" listing positive and negative consequences as "Good, because" and "Bad, because"
* Section "Consequences" listing positive and negative consequences as "Positive, because" and "Negative, because"
* No sections "Consequences", "Positive Consequences", and "Negative Consequences"

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 'Section "Consequences" listing positive and negative consequences as "Good, because" and "Bad, because"', because resolves all forces.
