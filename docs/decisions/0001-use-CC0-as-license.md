# Use CC0 as license

Everything needs to be licensed, otherwise the default copyright laws apply.
For instance, in Germany that means users may not alter anything without explicitly asking for permission.
For more information see <https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/>.

We want to have MADR used without any hassle and that users can just go ahead and write MADRs.

## Considered Options

* [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)
* No license
* Other open source licenses

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "CC0", because this license donates the content to "public domain" and does so as legally as possible.
