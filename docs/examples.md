# Examples

MADR is a template allowing to craft short, medium-sized, and large decision records.
There is no formal definition of short, medium-sized, and large decision records.
The following sections present an example in the context of assertion frameworks for Java.
We start with presenting a very short and dense version:
It "just" lists the context and problem statement, the available options, and the outcome.
For some decisions, these bits of information could not be enough.
Therefore, it is possible to "unpack" the decision.
This is done in the presented longer version of the ADR.

## Short Version

```markdown
# Use Plain JUnit5 for advanced test assertions

## Context and Problem Statement

How to write readable test assertions?
How to write readable test assertions for advanced tests?

## Considered Options

* Plain JUnit5
* Hamcrest
* AssertJ

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Plain JUnit5", because it is a standard framework and the features of the other frameworks do not outweigh the drawbrack of adding a new dependency.
```

## Long Version

This longer version of the above ADR adds pros and cons of the options, positive and negative consequences, as well as some more information.

# Use Plain JUnit5 for advanced test assertions

## Context and Problem Statement

How to write readable test assertions?
How to write readable test assertions for advanced tests?

## Considered Options

* Plain JUnit5
* Hamcrest
* AssertJ

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Plain JUnit5", because comes out best (see below).

### Consequences

* Good, because tests are more readable
* Good, because more easy to write tests
* Good, because more readable assertions
* Bad, because more complicated testing leads to more complicated assertions

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Plain JUnit5

Homepage: <https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/>
JabRef testing guidelines: <https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/code-howtos#test-cases>

Example:

```java
String actual = markdownFormatter.format(source);
assertTrue(actual.contains("Markup<br />"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("<li>list item one</li>"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("<li>list item 2</li>"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("> rest"));
assertFalse(actual.contains("\n"));
```

* Good, because Junit5 is "common Java knowledge"
* Bad, because complex assertions tend to get hard to read
* Bad, because no fluent API

### Hamcrest

Homepage: <https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest>

* Good, because offers advanced matchers (such as `contains`)
* Bad, because not full fluent API
* Bad, because entry barrier is increased

### AssertJ

Homepage: <https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/>

Example:

```java
assertThat(markdownFormatter.format(source))
        .contains("Markup<br />")
        .contains("<li>list item one</li>")
        .contains("<li>list item 2</li>")
        .contains("> rest")
        .doesNotContain("\n");
```

* Good, because offers fluent assertions
* Good, because allows partial string testing to focus on important parts
* Good, because assertions are more readable
* Bad, because not commonly used
* Bad, because newcomers have to learn an additional language to express test cases
* Bad, because entry barrier is increased
* Bad, because expressions of test cases vary from unit test to unit test
