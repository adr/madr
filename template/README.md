# Decision Templates

For new Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), please use one of the following templates as a starting point: 

* [adr-template.md](adr-template.md) has all sections, with explanations about them.
* [adr-template-minmal.md](adr-template-minimal.md) only contains mandatory sections, with explanations about them. <!-- ### Consequences also contained, though marked as "optional" -->
* [adr-template-bare.md](adr-template-bare.md) has all sections, wich are empty (no explanations).
* [adr-template-bare-minimal.md](adr-template-bare-minimal.md) has the mandatory sections, without explanations. <!-- ### Consequences also contained, though marked as "optional" -->
