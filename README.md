  parent: Decisions
  nav_order: 100
  title: ADR Template
  ---
  ```

## How to start Jekyll locally

For rendedring the `docs` directory, Jekyll is needed.

For local development, follow the [Jekyll installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
Installing the latest version of ruby followed by `gem install bundler` should be enough.

Afterwards, run

```terminal
bundle install
jekyll serve --livereload
```

and go to <http://localhost:4000/madr/> in your browser.

On Windows, using a dockerized environment is recommended:

```terminal
docker run -p 4000:4000 --rm --volume="C:\git-repositories\adr.github.io\madr\docs":/srv/jekyll jekyll/jekyll:4 jekyll serve
```

In case you get errors regarding `Gemfile.lock`, just delete `Gemfile.lock` and rerun.
