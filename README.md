## Overview

An [Architectural Decision (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. 
This might, for instance, be a technology choice (e.g., Java vs. JavaScript), a choice of the IDE (e.g., IntelliJ vs. Eclipse IDE), a choice between a library (e.g., [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) vs [java.util.logging](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html)), or a decision on features (e.g., infinite undo vs. limited undo).
Do not take the term "architecture" too seriously or interpret it too strongly.
As the examples illustrate, any decisions that might have an impact on the architecture somehow are architectural decisions.

It should be as easy as possible to
a) write down the decisions and
b) to version the decisions.

This repository offers a solution to record architectural decisions.
It provides files to document Architectural Decisions using **M**arkdown and **A**rchitectural **D**ecision **R**ecords.

Since MADR 3.0.0, the decisions are placed in the folder `docs/decisions` to

1) Enable [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to render it using the web.
   See <https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/> for more information.
2) Separate the architectural decisions from other documentation.

The filenames are following the pattern `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md` ([ADR-0005](docs/decisions/0005-use-dashes-in-filenames.md)), where

- `NNNN` is a consecutive number and we assume that there won't be more than 9,999 ADRs in one repository.
- the title is stored using dashes and lowercase, because [adr-tools] also does that.
- the suffix is `.md`, because it is a [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) file.

## The Template

The template reads as follows:

```markdown
# {short title of solved problem and solution}

* Status: {proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | … | superseded by [ADR-0005](0005-example.md)} <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: {list everyone involved in the decision} <!-- optional -->
* Date: {YYYY-MM-DD when the decision was last updated} <!-- optional -->

Technical Story: {description | ticket/issue URL} <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.}

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* {driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* {driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* {option 1}
* {option 2}
* {option 3}
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{option 1}", because {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* {e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …}
* …

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* {e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, …}
* …

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### {option 1}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …} <!-- optional -->

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Bad, because {argument c}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### {option 2}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …} <!-- optional -->

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Bad, because {argument c}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### {option 3}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …} <!-- optional -->

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Bad, because {argument c}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

## Links <!-- optional -->

* {Link type} {Link to ADR} <!-- example: Refined by [ADR-0005](0005-example.md) -->
* … <!-- numbers of links can vary -->
```

The template is available at [template/template.md](https://github.com/adr/madr/blob/main/template/template.md).

## Example

```markdown
# Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record architectural decisions made in this project.
Which format and structure should these records follow?

## Considered Options

* [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 2.1.0 - The Markdown Architectural Decision Records
* [Michael Nygard's template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) - The first incarnation of the term "ADR"
* [Sustainable Architectural Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) - The Y-Statements
* Other templates listed at <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>
* Formless - No conventions for file format and structure

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR 2.1.0", because

* Implicit assumptions should be made explicit.
  Design documentation is important to enable people understanding the decisions later on.
  See also [A rational design process: How and why to fake it](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940).
* The MADR format is lean and fits our development style.
* The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance.
* The MADR project is vivid.
* Version 2.1.0 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs.
```

The example is rendered at [template/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md](template/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md)

For the MADR project itself, all ADRs exist at [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/).

## Apply it to your project

### Initialization

Create folder `docs/decisions` in your project.
Copy all files in `template` from the MADR project to the folder `docs/decisions` in your project.

For instance, using `npm`, this can be done using the following command:

```sh
npm install madr && mkdir -p docs/decisions && cp node_modules/madr/template/* docs/decisions/
```

### Create a new ADR

Manual approach:

1. Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`, where `NNNN` indicates the next number in sequence.
2. Edit `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`.
3. Update `index.md`, e.g., by executing `adr-log -d .`
   You can get [adr-log](https://github.com/adr/adr-log) by executing `npm install -g adr-log`.

Note you can also use [other patterns for the directory format](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record#adr-file-name-conventions), but then the tools cannot be applied.

Automatic approach:

Use [our fork](https://github.com/adr/adr-tools/tree/patch-1) of [adr-tools].
See <https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/pull/43> for the current status of integration.

### Development

* MADR follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) and documents changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` following [keep a changelog 1.0.0](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
* Issues can be reported at <https://github.com/adr/madr/issues>.
* Use the [Markdown Style Guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/) space-sentence:1, wrap:sentence, header:atx, list-marker:asterisk, list-space:1, code:fenced

**Releasing a new version:**

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
1. Update `README.md` with the new template and the example.
1. Adapt the version reference in `template/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md`.
1. Copy `template/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md` to `docs/decisions/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md`.
1. Update `package.json`, publish to [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/madr), create GitHub release.  
   Use [release-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it) (do not create a release on GitHub) and [github-release-from-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-release-from-changelog).
